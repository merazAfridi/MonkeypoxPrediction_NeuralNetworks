# MonkeypoxPrediction_NeuralNetworks

On a dataset of 228 photos with 102 images of monkey pox and 126 images of other skin diseases, I applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are used to categorize pictures of monkey pox and other skin conditions. The CNN demonstrated its ability for reliable classification with a test accuracy of roughly 0.644 and a test loss of 0.959. The CNN's ability to attain good accuracy even with insufficient data is indicative of its usefulness, especially with its modest architecture consisting of only two max-pooling layers and two convolutional layers. Nevertheless, accuracy can still be increased. This could be done by using data augmentation techniques, larger datasets, or more intricate CNN structures. Although further research is required to increase CNNs' accuracy, the study shows their potential for creating diagnostic tools for these illnesses.
